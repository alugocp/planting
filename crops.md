## Raised Bed Design
### Hugelkultur
According to this [hugelkultur source](https://www.almanac.com/what-hugelkultur-ultimate-raised-bed), it's fairly easy to create a bed.
You need to stack rotting wood (tree branches or logs) underneath other yard scraps and some topsoil, then let it sit from fall to spring.
It should be completely filled in with yard waste and watered to keep it wet.
It's a way to make a super fertile natural raised bed.

### Unframed Raised Beds
Raised beds can be made without walls.
These are known as unframed or mounded beds.
You will need to slope the dirt on the sides of the bed to help keep it all in place.
These beds don't last as long as walled ones, so you'll have to fix them up every year or two [[source]](https://www.gardeningknowhow.com/edible/vegetables/vgen/making-unframed-raised-beds.htm).
These sorts of beds were also used for Indigenous 3 sisters farming all over the Americas.

This PDF ([Building a Free-Standing No-Dig Garden](https://ahsgardening.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/No-Dig-Garden-TAG-JF21-1.pdf)) details some of the recent developments in unbounded raised beds.
It goes over no-dig practices in conjunction with raised beds, and describes some of them as "compost piles that you plant in."
It seems you can set up raised beds in a similar way to compost piles.

### Materials
#### Lumber
There are several different types of lumber, some of which are toxic (can leach arsenic or copper) [[source]](https://www.finegardening.com/article/are-pressure-treated-woods-safe-in-garden-beds).
The EPA banned the use of lumber treated with chromated copper arsenate (CCA) for residential use back in 2003.
Nowadays lumber is pressure treated with alkaline copper quat (ACQ) or copper azole (CA-B).
These both have copper and a fungicide in them.
Copper is less toxic than arsenic, but would be a problem if you get a significant portion of your diet from your garden vegetables (so it doesn't work for the purposes of this project).
The article linked says there is likely little risk (because plants die if they take up too much copper) but I'd rather be safe since the idea is to eat as much locally produced food as possible.

Better alternatives to pressure-treated wood (at least for raised beds) are decay-resistant wood like redwood or red cedar.
You can also use recycled plastic lumber (TREX is a good source for that).
Or raised beds can be made as mounds with sloped sides, so it does not require any holding material.

#### Glass Bottles
You can use [glass bottles in cement](https://digginginthegarden.com/make-hot-garden-bed-with-recycled-wine-bottles/) to create a "hot bed".
Apparently the air in the glass bottles will get heated by the sun and keep the soil temperature warmer.
This might be useful for growing cacti or melons (or other warmer climate plants).

#### Burlap Sack
Burlap is made from the Jute plant.
Sacks can be filled with dirt and used for planting, with a couple of advantages.
For one, the weave of the sack allows for better aeration of your soil.
Not everything can be grown in a burlap sack due to size constraints, but it seems really good for herbs. It's also good for a few popular vegetables such as potatoes, peppers and tomatoes [[source]](https://homegrownfun.com/burlap-sacks-in-garden-grow-vegetables-in-bags/).

## Corn
Corn is one of the plants I'm most excited to grow.
It will be a little tricky to grow corn because different varieties will cross-pollinate if they're grown too close together.
The safe area to grow corn at is 100 - 1000ft apart per variety, but having a house in between varieties help.
Corn varieties can also be grown 3 - 4 weeks apart so that they miss each other's tasseling stage.
I have access to the following varieties:
- Hopi Turquoise
- Hopi Purple
- Montana Morada
- Cherokee White Eagle
- Dakota Black Popcorn
- Burro Mountain Popcorn
- Grinding Corn
- Sweet Corn

These all prefer temperatures of 75 - 80 F.
Most corn requires 55 - 90 days of ideal temperature to fully mature (after which you'll have fertilized corn that can be used to grow more).
I plan to grow corn varieties in 4 locations offset by 4 weeks per group, like so:
- Week 1 (May):  Sweet Corn, Grinding Corn, Burro Mountain Popcorn, Dakota Black Popcorn (Fully mature by end of July)
- Week 5 (June): Montana Morada, Cherokee White Eagle, Hopi Turquoise and Hopi Purple (Fully mature by end of August)
