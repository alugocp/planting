# Planting Project
This is my planting project design for College Park.
I want to produce my own compost and use that to grow crops and native plants throughout my neighbors' yards.
The idea is to show people that subsistence agriculture is still an option, and to help promote biodiversity while doing so.

## Scope
The research scope of this project includes the following.

### Compost
- Compostable materials
- Affordable and sustainable composter design
- How to compost safely and efficiently

### Native Ecosystem
- Native plants
- Pollinators and pollinator plants
- Native animals to grow plants for
- Invasive species to remove if possible

### Crop Production
- Nutritional or medicinal crops to grow
- Best sustainable growing practices
- Traditional and safe pest control methods

## Todo
### Research
- [x] Learn about raised bed designs with cheap, safe, and sustainable materials
- [x] Research safe composter design and compostable materials
- [ ] Identify plants that help shape or retain soil (lavender, marigolds, etc)
- [ ] Canvas around the street to see who else is interested
- [ ] Identify traditional companion crop methods
- [ ] Find native trees, crops, flowers and grasses to grow
- [ ] Look up water wicking and auto-watering strategies
- [ ] Find out how to make vegetable char

### Initial tests at home
- [x] Build a few bird houses
- [x] Grow root vegetables with Ruth Stout method
- [ ] Create giant composter in back yard
- [ ] Make some bird feeders too
- [ ] Build some raised beds using different methods
- [ ] Identify a sun map of the houses I want to garden in
- [ ] Set up some trellises
- [ ] Dig a burn pit

### Expansion (test run)
- [ ] Start building on interested peoples' yards
- [ ] Find new organic materials to make biochar out of
- [ ] Ask businesses and the city to see who's interested in becoming a part of this
- [ ] Provide some crops to the food bank
- [ ] Start propagating native trees
- [ ] Set up a website to track all of this information and processes
