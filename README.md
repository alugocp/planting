# Planting Project
This is my planting project design for College Park.
I want to produce my own compost and use that to grow crops and native plants throughout my neighbors' yards.
The idea is to show people that subsistence agriculture is still an option, and to help promote biodiversity while doing so.

## Table of Contents
- [compost](./compost.html) details garden nutrition plans
- [crops](./crops.html) compiles information on desired crops and how to grow them
- [native](./native.html) contains information on native Maryland plants
- [researchers](./researchers.html) lists a few people of interest in my research

## Scope
The research scope of this project includes the following:

### Compost
- Compostable materials
- Affordable and sustainable composter design
- How to compost safely and efficiently

### Native Ecosystem
- Native plants
- Pollinators and pollinator plants
- Native animals to grow plants for
- Invasive species to remove if possible

### Crop Production
- Nutritional or medicinal crops to grow
- Best sustainable growing practices
- Traditional and safe pest control methods

## Todo
### Research
- [x] Learn about raised bed designs with cheap, safe, and sustainable materials
- [x] Research safe composter design and compostable materials
- [x] Find native trees, crops, flowers and grasses to grow
- [x] Identify traditional companion crop methods
- [x] Identify plants that help shape or retain soil (lavender, marigolds, etc)
- [x] Canvas around the street to see who else is interested
- [x] Find out how to make vegetable char
- [ ] Look up water wicking and auto-watering strategies

### Initial tests at home
- [x] Build a few bird houses
- [x] Grow root vegetables with Ruth Stout method
- [x] Create giant composter in back yard
- [x] Build some raised beds using different methods
- [x] Set up some trellises
- [ ] Make some bird feeders too
- [ ] Dig a burn pit

### Expansion (test run)
- [x] Set up a website to track all of this information and processes
- [ ] Deploy home-made grass/leaf compost
- [ ] Start building on interested peoples' yards
- [ ] Find new organic materials to make biochar out of
- [ ] Ask businesses and the city to see who's interested in becoming a part of this
- [ ] Provide some crops to the food bank
- [ ] Start propagating native trees
