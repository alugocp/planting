This file is for compost-related research.

## Miscellaneous Resources
- [Gardening with clay soil](https://blog.seedsavers.org/blog/gardening-with-clay-soil) contains a lot of methods for amending clay soil

## Composter design
### Materials
#### Lumber
Don't use ACC treated wood, since it can leach arsenic [[source]](https://homeguides.sfgate.com/can-use-treated-lumber-compost-bin-78391.html).
The risks of human illness are reportedly low, but you at least shouldn't grow vegetables near CCA-treated wood.
ACQ wood releases more copper into the soil than ACC does, but copper is less toxic than arsenic.
The acidity of composts high in organic matter can increase the amount of copper or arsenic absorbed into the soil, but it also binds those materials to the compost.
This makes it harder for plants to absorb the toxic materials.
It's also worth noting that copper is a micronutrient that plants need to grow (although in comparatively trace amounts to Nitrogen and other nutrients).

You can also use naturally resistant woods like cedar, redwood or white oak.

### Notes
- Cold corners are the corners of a rectangular compost bin that don't heat up as much and may be hard to reach with a pitchfork. Circular compost bins don't have these cold corners.
- Plastic bins are black so that the materials inside get hotter [[source]](https://www.planetnatural.com/buyers-guide/).

## Compostable Materials
The following materials are compostable:
- [Human hair](https://www.gardeningknowhow.com/composting/ingredients/composting-hair.htm) is compostable as a green material
